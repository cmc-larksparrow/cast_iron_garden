This is a book about why native plants are important, how to garden with them in central Oklahoma, and species accounts for species that work well here in central Oklahoma.  It is licensed so that others could use a similar model for other regions, once it's more developed.  I also hope to make the species account auto-generate from a spreadsheet so that it's easy to add new ones or new fields if we change things later, instead of manually editing every page.
